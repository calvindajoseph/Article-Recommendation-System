Betsy DeVos Expands Dangerous Exemptions for Religious Colleges and Universities,Washington D C Today American Atheists denounced the Department of Education s Title IX regulation changes which expand religious exemptions for schools and weaken protections for victims of sexual harassment Betsy DeVos new policy helps religious schools engage in sex based discrimination trampling students basic rights said Alison Gill Vice President for Legal and Policy at American Atheists Students regardless of whether they re attending a public or private religious school should be able to focus on their education not worry about what laws apply to them and whether their own school will subject them to harassment or discrimination based on their beliefs Prior to this new rule religious institutions had to provide the Department of Education notice of their intention to ignore basic nondiscrimination protections Now they can claim an exemption at any time and without warning Students will be left in the dark about whether their college or university plans to respect their fundamental rights Disturbingly they will only find out after the fact after an incident of discrimination Students must have the right to make decisions about their education and to protect themselves from discrimination said Gill Not only will religious colleges and universities no longer have to come clean about their discriminatory intentions but now they can put out a seemingly nondiscriminatory policy to attract students only to reverse course after discrimination has occurred added Gill The hypocrisy and bad faith of Betsy DeVos and her Religious Right followers is palpable said Nick Fish president of American Atheists For someone who claims to treasure family values she is sure ready to bend over backwards to empower perpetrators of sexual harassment and discrimination In addition to the changes to how colleges and universities may apply religious exemptions these new rules will undermine enforcement of sexual harassment policies and undermine protections for subject those who have experienced sexual harassment Image by Gage Skidmore under CC BY SA 2 0The post Betsy DeVos Expands Dangerous Exemptions for Religious Colleges and Universities appeared first on American Atheists ,American Atheists,Public Policy,American Atheists Magazine,https://www.atheists.org/2020/05/title-ix-religious-exemptions/,4,18

Largest Survey on Nonreligious Americans Reveals Widespread Discrimination and Stigma,Cranford NJ Today the nonreligious identity organization American Atheists released Reality Check Being Nonreligious in America a comprehensive report drawn from the groundbreaking U S Secular Survey Counting nearly 34 000 nonreligious participants and organized by a team of researchers at Strength in Numbers Consulting Group the U S Secular Survey is the largest ever data collection project on secular Americans and their experiences At 75 million people religiously unaffiliated Americans are as large a demographic as either Evangelical Christians or Catholics and explicitly nonreligious people comprise a growing share of the population yet before the U S Secular Survey there had been a lack of focused research on our community said Alison Gill Vice President for Legal and Policy at American Atheists who helped lead the project What we found shocked us Discrimination and stigma against nonreligious Americans is widespread and extremely harmful Due to their nonreligious identity more than half of participants 54 5 had negative experiences with family members nearly one third 29 4 in education and more than one in five 21 7 in the workplace Of those who experienced discrimination within their families there was a 73 3 higher rate of likely depression This report shows that the more religious the community the more likely nonreligious people are to face discrimination and stigma said Gill Nonreligious Americans living in very religious communities concentrated in rural areas and the South are particularly at risk The nearly one third of participants 29 8 living in very religious communities were nearly two and a half times more likely to experience discrimination in education two and a half times more likely in public services voting jury duty poll work more than three times more likely in employent and more than two times more likely when dealing with private businesses compared to those living in not at all religious communities The struggles of nonreligious Americans are far too often overlooked Thankfully the U S Secular Survey has revealed the discrimination our community regularly faces said Nick Fish president of American Atheists With that well established we need to find solutions and work toward ending the stigma faced by our community The report found that involvement with organized secular community groups is an important protective factor that correlated with reduced likelihood of loneliness and depression Members of national secular organizations were 34 8 less likely than non members to be at risk for depression while members of local secular groups were 29 3 less likely Now that we know the power of organized secularism it s up to secular organizations to advocate for change and provide as many nonreligious Americans as possible with the support and community they need added Fish The post Largest Survey on Nonreligious Americans Reveals Widespread Discrimination and Stigma appeared first on American Atheists ,American Atheists,News,American Atheists Magazine,https://www.atheists.org/2020/05/reality-check-being-nonreligious-in-america/,4,0
Congress Authorizes Another Unconstitutional Giveaway for Religious Worship in Latest Coronavirus Stimulus,Washington D C Today the religious equality watchdog organization American Atheists condemned Congress s failure to include necessary constitutional protections in the 484 billion aid bill passed by the House of Representatives As a result the additional 310 billion injected into the Small Business Administration s Paycheck Protection Program can unconstitutionally fund religious worship Congress must include these First Amendment protections in any future stimulus bills particularly after the Small Business Administration weakened its own regulations allowing the original 350 billion in stimulus money to fund religious worship said Alison Gill Vice President for Legal and Policy at American Atheists Longstanding SBA regulations had prevented businesses principally engaged in teaching instructing counselling or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs whether in a religious or secular setting from receiving business or economic disaster loans However with its guidance on the Paycheck Protection Program from the CARES Act SBA suddenly indicated in early April that it would decline to enforce these subsections If the SBA won t do its job and protect the Constitution Congress must finally step in said Nick Fish President of American Atheists Congress is rushing to replenish Paycheck Protection Program funds after countless businesses were unable to access these loans to preserve jobs What we don t know is how many well heeled mega churches were able to secure government money to pay their pastors salary while small businesses were left out in the cold Thousands and thousands of our supporters have warned Congress that these stimulus bills fail to adequately protect the constitutional separation of religion and government 8221 said Gill Accountability transparency and adherence to the Constitution are critical especially in the face of a crisis The post Congress Authorizes Another Unconstitutional Giveaway for Religious Worship in Latest Coronavirus Stimulus appeared first on American Atheists ,American Atheists,Statements,American Atheists Magazine,https://www.atheists.org/2020/04/small-business-administration-310-billion-churches/,0,18

Little Sisters Supreme Court Case Could Grant Religious Groups Carte Blanche to Ignore the Law,Washington D C Today American Atheists joined other secular organizations in filing an amicus brief in the Little Sisters of the Poor v Pennsylvania case one of the most important religious exemption cases before the U S Supreme Court this term In the 2016 Supreme Court case Zubik v Burwell religious organizations including Little Sisters of the Poor challenged the religious accommodation that had been carved out of the Affordable Care Act s contraceptive mandate In order to exempt themselves from the obligation to provide health insurance that included no cost contraception coverage religious organizations were required to notify the government that they wished to be exempt by completing a half page form Little Sisters of the Poor among others argued that even this involved them too much in the sin of reproductive health Now Little Sisters of the Poor and its cohorts want a second bite at the apple In its current case against the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey Little Sisters of the Poor alleges once again that merely providing this notice to the government is a substantial burden on their religious exercise What Little Sisters of the Poor is asking for is an exemption from an exemption one just for religious groups To claim that signing a piece of paper is a burden let alone substantially burdensome is absurd said Geoffrey T Blackwell litigation counsel at American Atheists Little Sisters of the Poor do not have the right to dictate how the government will administer that exemption According to well established precedent a religious person or group must always provide the government with notice in order to avail themselves of a religious exemption Conscientious objectors wishing to forgo combat must file a claim of religious or philosophical objection Religious adherents wanting to drink hallucinogenic tea ceremonially must file for an exemption or may face criminal penalties Parents who choose to remove their children from school on religious grounds must inform school officials or else they could be charged with a misdemeanor Little Sisters of the Poor s claim that filing paperwork somehow involves them in sin and distant complicity makes no sense added Blackwell Even if the Little Sisters of the Poor truly believed this the Court can and should find that mailing in a piece of paper is in no way a substantial burden on anyone s religious expression Were the Supreme Court to rule otherwise the term substantial burden would lose all meaning and the Court would open the floodgates to ever more absurd claims Behind Little Sisters of the Poor s sugarsweet veneer lies the ideologically driven desire to deny every woman in America the right to access contraceptive coverage said Nick Fish president of American Atheists Religious employers have every right to police their own bodies but not those of their employees Religious groups must follow the law To allow them to demand an exemption from an exemption would make our democracy wholly unworkable he added The post Little Sisters Supreme Court Case Could Grant Religious Groups Carte Blanche to Ignore the Law appeared first on American Atheists ,American Atheists,Legal,American Atheists Magazine,https://www.atheists.org/2020/04/little-sisters-supreme-court-case/,0,0
Oppose Religious Exemptions that Help Spread COVID 19,During this crisis many state governors have wisely issued executive orders or guidelines that limit the size of gatherings encourage social distancing and limit nonessential activities to protect public health and prevent the spread of potentially deadly coronavirus Unfortunately numerous states have included religious exemptions for places of worship allowing them to meet and put the public health at risk Please ask your governor to either refrain from creating religious exemptions or rescind them today No one should have the right to risk others lives because of their religious beliefs In Washington DC California and New York hundreds of people were exposed to coronavirus through religious gatherings Additional outbreaks in Kansas Arkansas and North Carolina have shown that churches also put rural communities at risk during this epidemic Ask your governor to ensure the same does not happen in your state There is no constitutional obligation to exempt religious groups from public health and safety regulations particularly when lives are on the line Our government has a compelling interest in protecting public health and it can limit in person gatherings even for churches Please write to your governor today and ask them to ensure that special privileges for churches do not put at risk the health and safety of all residents The post Oppose Religious Exemptions that Help Spread COVID 19 appeared first on American Atheists ,American Atheists,Action Alert,American Atheists Magazine,https://www.atheists.org/2020/04/religious-exemptions-coronavirus/,4,13
Government to Pay Pastor Salaries in 350 Billion Small Business Aid Package,Washington D C Today the religious equality watchdog organization American Atheists denounced the Small Business Administration SBA s recently released regulations and guidance on the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security CARES Act as an unconstitutional giveaway to houses of worship that is ripe for abuse These news rules give houses of worship access to 350 billion in federal money from the Paycheck Protection Program PPP to fund religious activities including paying clergy salaries rent and utilities Longstanding SBA regulations have prevented businesses principally engaged in teaching instructing counselling or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs whether in a religious or secular setting from receiving business or economic disaster loans However with its news guidance SBA indicates that it will decline to enforce these subsections Direct government subsidy of religious activity is the clearest example of a violation of the Establishment Clause imaginable said Alison Gill Vice President for Legal and Policy at American Atheists SBA cannot simply change its rules to sidestep the clear limits of the Constitution This program was created by Congress to protect small businesses Instead SBA is giving churches easier access to funding than businesses or other nonprofits Gill added According to SBA s guidance unlike other nonprofits houses of worship need not apply for 501 c 3 status to be eligible for PPP funding In addition affiliation rules which can disqualify businesses and nonprofits from receiving PPP funding do not apply to houses of worship allowing individual churches affiliated with larger denominations to receive direct funding These religious exemptions turn the CARES Act into a taxpayer giveaway to churches and shields them from government oversight said Gill Unlike all other nonprofits houses of worship do not file tax returns preventing any federal oversight of their use of this money We have to be even more vigilant during a crisis like this to prevent our government from ignoring its obligations under the Constitution said Nick Fish president of American Atheists This bill contains provisions allowing the American people to support their houses of worship if they choose to do so with additional tax breaks on donations And just as the Founders intended that s to whom churches should turn when they need help Not the federal government It s unconscionable that with more than 10 million Americans out of work the SBA is subsidizing wealthy religious groups and mega churches with untold billions of taxpayer money added Fish American Atheists along with a coalition of seven other civil rights and religious equality advocates previously advised the SBA of its obligations under the Constitution in the administration of this program Photo by Jer123 via Shutterstock comThe post Government to Pay Pastor Salaries in 350 Billion Small Business Aid Package appeared first on American Atheists ,American Atheists,Public Policy,American Atheists Magazine,https://www.atheists.org/2020/04/churches-preference-small-business-aid-package/,0,18

Tools For Growth A Case Study Processing UC Green s Planting Records Using Remote Software Tools,Urban tree inventories typically require extensive field work for data collection but a new software tool has been developed to remotely determine an urban forest s features using publicly available online images In this study tree planting records from UC Green were processed for current features and environmental impacts using only remote data collection and data management tools Trees in the organization s planting record were first located geographically identified by genus and species and then algorithmically measured for diameter After aggregating and verifying fifteen years of bi annual planting records and processing them with the remote tools the full record was entered into a live database to facilitate monitoring and maintenance and then analyzed for its provision of ecosystem services Out of 1485 street trees confirmed planted by the nonprofit 1232 were found to be presently living with the most common species being Syringa reticulata Japanese tree lilac Acer rubrum red maple and Gleditsia triacanthos Honey locust Some key impacts of this work were determining the size and scope of the nonprofit s planting accomplishments as well as estimated ecosystem services and the facilitation of future monitoring and planting operational performance assessment The impacts of the UC Green s tree plantings can be increased further as operations are augmented according to the suggested recommendations which were based on the study s results ,Ethan Eric Leatherbarrow,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/17,4,18
Equality Capability and Neurodiversity,The challenges of neurodiversity have been most directly explored in debate around the demands of equality in a democracy The debate roughly divides into two camps democratic equality and the capabilities approach Neurodiverstiy raises at least one central question that helps to think through the debate over these two conceptions of equality how do different capabilities and differing levels of ability affect the demands of equality in country that prides itself on having free and equal citizens Democratic equality with its overt focus citizen s role as a citizen pays insufficient attention to individual s neurological and psychological differences The capabilities approach provides a better place to start in our theorizing about neurodiversity By focusing on what individuals can do with resources in a particular context it incorporates human variation as a starting point in the justice debate Two questions however loom large First recognizing human variation will make some less independent how should we determine who gets included as an equal member in society Second what limits if any are there on how many resources can justly be spent on the project of attaining equality I suggest our best current approach brings together elements from the capabilities framework thereby adopting a better framework for capturing neurodiversity and an institutional approach more readily aligned with democratic equality providing resources for a principled limit on the demands of justice Using this framework I briefly argue for a presumption of inclusion and present several considerations to mitigate the worry about limits ,Doug Paletta,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/16,4,18
How to Overcome Strawson s Point Defending a Value Oriented Foundation for Contractualism,In The Second Person Standpoint Darwall charges that all value oriented foundations for ethics make a category mistake Calling it Strawson s point he argues these foundations explain moral authority which concerns whether someone has standing to hold another accountable in terms of a value which essentially concerns what makes the world go best However whether it would be good for me to blame you simply asks a different question than whether I have standing to blame you I defend a value oriented foundation for contractualism by identifying one way to overcome Strawson s point At bottom Darwall s objection relies on the assumption that all values are world regarding I argue that another class of values exists second personal values Grounding morality in one of these values does not make the category mistake at the heart of Strawson s point In particular I argue that grounding morality on one second personal value the ideal of acting justifiably towards others better captures traditional contractualist ideals than Darwall s formal foundation ,Doug Paletta,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/15,4,19
Francis Hutcheson Why Be Moral ,Like all theories that account for moral motivation Francis Hutcheson s moral sense theory faces two related challenges The skeptical challenge calls into question what reasons an agent has to be moral at all The priority challenge asks why an agent s reasons to be moral tend to outweigh her non moral reasons to act I argue a defender of Hutcheson can respond to these challenges by building on unique features of his account She can respond to skeptical challenge by drawing a direct parallel between an agent s reasons to pursue natural self directed goods and her reasons to pursue moral goods This parallel however makes establishing the significance of morality difficult Given this difficulty a separate aspect of Hutcheson s account the additional weight given to benevolence in our assessment of mixed actions can be used to respond to the priority challenge ,Doug Paletta,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/14,4,19
The Structural Competence of Contractualism,The contractualist account of wrongness faces a family of objections that all aim to show that the account is explanatorily inadequate These objections often level claims of circularity or redundancy and interpreted as an internal challenge they present formal objections to the account of wrongness If correct they show that structurally contractualism fails to provide an independent account of wrongness because its determinations of wrongness necessarily rely on a non contractual basis Rather than respond to particular versions of these objections I identify the elements of contractualism that may provide a basis for a charge of redundancy or circularity the objections to a principle of action the basis for assessing the objections and the reason giving force of wrongness Then I show that accounting for the wrongness of an action at any of these stages either fails to capture the contractual account of wrongness or does not invoke a non contractualist standard Building on the ideal of justifiability contractualists can provide an in principle response to these structural challenges ,Doug Paletta,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/13,4,15
Investigation of the Effect of the Temperature of Intake Air on the Economy and Torque of a Gasoline Engine,The object of this investigation is to make a study of the effect on the economy and torque of a gasoline motor of heating the air going to the carburetor The knowledge gained from such an investigation is of considerable importance and might be used in determining the temperature at which to supply air to the carburetor of a motor in order to get the best results under its working conditions General practice indicates that a motor will run more smoothly and first regularly when the temperature of the intake air is 150 degrees or more The theory is that up to a certain point the economy becomes better with increasing air temperatures The brake horsepower however falls off as the temperature is raised Assuming then that we have an unlimited heating source it is our purpose to find the best temperature to use in order to obtain the highest economy without seriously reducing the torque Also the effects at various loads and speeds will be considered With the poor grade of gasoline now being supplied this investigation should be of the utmost value ,Arthur W.

Critical Care Nursing of Infants and Children,This publication of the second edition of Critical Care Nursing of Infants and Children is another important milestone in the evolving development of pediatric critical care nursing It often surprises students and colleagues when I discuss my experiences in the days before pediatric intensive care units They cannot conceive of a time when these specialized units along with their highly technologic treatments were not available to facilitate the care of critically ill children During this before period seriously ill children were cared for on regular hospital units with minimal technology Staff nurses were often assigned to special the child unless the family provided a private duty nurse Sometimes a separate room was set aside for care of several seriously ill children so that one nurse could care for several children The level of expertise of these staff and private duty nurses however was not adequate for the intensive care needs of critically ill children Obviously children with serious health problems or children recovering from major surgery were at high risk of dying because adequate treatments and monitoring measures were not available ,Martha A.

Biopsy,The biopsy may very well be the most paramount procedure confronting the dentist and successful tissue diagnosis depends on proper surgical biopsy technique Yet how many who are faced with this procedure really know the principles involved and can carry them out flawlessly as they must be The practitioner who attempts this procedure without being aware of principles involved may prevent more competent hands from diagnosing a malignancy until it is too late Data bares out the fact that the first man to see a lesion is in the best position to initiate a cure The aim of this paper is to present some of the principles of biopsy technique so as to give an insight into the procedure of biopsy ,Nathan Gross,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/3,4,13
A Perspective of the Prince Edward County Issue,The doors of public schools in Prince Edward County Virginia were closed at the end of the spring term of 1959 and have remained closed to both the county s white and Negro students ever since This action followed some five years of defiance of the famous U S Supreme Court decision of 1954 and has as of this writing made Prince Edward County the only locality in the United States which does not provide its youngsters with some kind of public education To the social scientist or to those who might be alarmed by such an extreme situation several questions are immediately raised Why were public schools closed and how did closing come about What kind of locality is this which would resort to such an extraordinary measure What generally are the attitudes and arguments underlying the issue Also what has happened to the county s people and its schools And finally what can we expect to happen in the future to public education in this Virginia county It is these questions which this paper will attempt to answer ,Edward Harden Peeples,,Penn Libraries University of Pennsylvania,https://repository.upenn.edu/miscellaneous_papers/2,0,18
